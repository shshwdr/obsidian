算数计算解密游戏，移动和加减乘除连接得到需要的数来解锁过关

如果把数字换成其他要件，比如炼金元素、生克五行、力智体敏等  
当成游戏内某个模块的中和环节（如技能开启、天赋觉醒、魔法充能等操作性模块）  
利用轻快的解锁体验来为大流程减压

可以类似[[mage of mystralia]]一样搞个法术编程类似的东西

you are a calculation operator(plus or minus or multiply), when you connect to a number you pick them. when you pick two on two side, then they calculate and get a result, the result will open the lock if they match the same value.

pros:
1. easy to start.
2. when you do a calculation, there is a fomulate shows up and you know what happens.
3. levels get harder when you need to connect two numbers together.
4. there are stone values that can't move but can only be used.
5. rotate to pass the walls and obstacles, rotate also means the operator and opeeratee can swap, and the number with multiple digit can swap. rotate happens around the character, so need to consider how to connect to rotate correctly and pass the walls..
6. we can have multiple operators too.
7. minus can be used as negative(this remind me of compiler so much..)
8. it has a hint! with a gentle nudge and a specific hint!
9. you can also create two formula rather than one, if they are not on the same row
