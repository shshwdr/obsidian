you are a calculation operator(plus or minus or multiply), when you connect to a number you pick them. when you pick two on two side, then they calculate and get a result, the result will open the lock if they match the same value.

pros:
1. easy to start.
2. when you do a calculation, there is a fomulate shows up and you know what happens.
3. levels get harder when you need to connect two numbers together.
4. there are stone values that can't move but can only be used.
5. rotate to pass the walls and obstacles, rotate also means the operator and opeeratee can swap, and the number with multiple digit can swap. rotate happens around the character, so need to consider how to connect to rotate correctly and pass the walls..
6. we can have multiple operators too.
7. minus can be used as negative(this remind me of compiler so much..)
8. it has a hint! with a gentle nudge and a specific hint!
9. you can also create two formula rather than one, if they are not on the same row
