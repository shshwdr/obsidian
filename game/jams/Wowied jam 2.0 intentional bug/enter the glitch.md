you need to think out of the box and modify files in the game folder to solve puzzles:

pros:
1. interesting levels, you will get hint in the error like a key is missing to open the door, and the key is ****V***, so you need to find the key with name match that pattern.
2. the final hint is from binary number, of course.
3. it feels good when you fix a bug and the OS turns on. just so good.


cons:
1. too hard to figure out what to do at first
2. you need to restart game every time after you changed the file.hmm kind of tedious.
