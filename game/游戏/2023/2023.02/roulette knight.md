This game can be fairly hard if you don't know understand statistics but there are a few ways you can minimize luck in your runs

1) ALWAYS use bullet gaps so if you get shot you will know how many times you can shoot before having to spin.

2)If you don't get shot ALWAYS re-spin your gun you no matter what your bullet gaps are it is always better to re-spin.

3)Armor sucks late game you should try to max out your max hp for late game.

3)Focus your stat points into health and max mana unless you are trying a dodge/misfire build the regen stats have better item alternatives.

This is the build i used to consistently win. it's optimized for not getting killed

 1) make your first shot contain 4 bullets and if it hits you restart 

2) try and get a domino as fast as you can. it will be the main part of this build for early game later game you will use the holy book and grail but the dominos are perfect for early. 

3) make sure you lvl HP once and get the heal skill after you get the heal skill only lvl up the main path of HP and Max mana. don't get any other skills till later. 

4) try and get a 9 or 10 round gun early to help minimize getting shot. 

5) once you have a good gun and domino/holy book you can start trying to get the holy grail and frog ring to max out your HP and mana 

6) after you have your gear build maxed then get the immortality skill all other points you get should go to max out your max mana and HP. 

7) in the last three areas use immortality for every shot and if you run out of mana then refill at the first area. 

8) win
