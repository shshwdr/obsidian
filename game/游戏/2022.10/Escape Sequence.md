平台跳跃+地图品阶+meta

Several interesting points:

1.  The winning point is shown at the beginning of the game. 
    
2.  The start button at the beginning is quite fun, you click the enter to rotate the enter button in the game, sadly it is not used later.
    
3.  You can pick up a block and put somewhere else to make it as a platform, but you can also pick up an empty to put it and make a road.
    
4.  There is a level in built by a mouse, if you dont move fast, the level will be more complicated and hard to finish
    
5.  One platform level is built when gravity is not topdown but left right, good for cervical disease..
    
6.  When you leave a level from the exit, you come from a platform game to a top down game.
    
7.  You can also pick up a level module and put it on other levels to “start it”
    
8.  You can also pick up the mouse to click something.. The winning point! 
    
9.  The levels are on a game engine’s scene(like some developer is developing it) if you go to the border of the black background, you can see the engine menu
